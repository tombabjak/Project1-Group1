# Covid-19 Effects and Projections
Project 1, Group 1 - February 2021   

Tom Babjak, Fleming Brathwaite, Alexander Gonzalez, Mona Peteet

Motivation & Summary:

Hypothesis:
If the covid pandemic affected the travelling economy then a decrease in mobility across various forms of transportation would be expected.

Exploration:
Seeking to analyze the economic impacts resulting from the pandemic in order to assess household income and travel spending impacts.
To review the travel implications and understand if the impacts were experienced across various forms of transportation, to determine if a particular form of travel was more affected than the other. 
Based on current trends in air-travel, what was the effect of COVID-19 in 2020, and when can we predict a return to ‘normalcy’?

Observations:
The resulting analysis demonstrated sharp declines after February 2020 for data analyzed in the areas of mobility.
There is a decrease in unemployment claims starting Fall/Winter 2020.  The causal factors were not explored as part of this project’s analysis. 
Impacts were slightly varied between states but some similarities exist.

Conclusions:
Our findings were to be expected as the circumstances and events are rather recent.
The resulting data extracted demonstrated that after initial dips a phase of recovery has been noted beginning Summer 2020.
There was difficulty in defining a quantitative baseline for normalcy.
With additional time we would:
Explore causal factors explaining recovery aspects (e.g. drops in unemployment claims)
Analyze the household spending activities (e.g. what are people spending on?)
